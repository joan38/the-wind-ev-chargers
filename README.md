# The Wind Electric Vehicle Chargers ⚡ Usage and Rules Study

We have 2 Tesla chargers (10kW max output) in the building open to all residents. Those 2 chargers are not enough given
the building is composed of 489 condo residences but this is better than nothing. So we need to maximize the utilization
of those chargers as well as making sure everyone has fair access to them.

## WhatsApp Group

We have a WhatsApp group for EV owners to coordinate charger usage. Members post "Freeing 1 charger" when they free up a
charger, so that others can use it ASAP. The goal of this group is to minimize the idle time of the chargers, maximize
usage of limited resources and make sure everyone gets a turn and no one is left unplugged 🚗🔌💚

This WhatsApp group contains 30 members at the time of this writing. Some might have 1 car for 2 members (husband and
wife) some might have 2 cars for 1 member? Or some might not even be in the group at all! We will assume N members = N
EV in the building.

There is a QR code on each charger that links to the WhatsApp group, so that anyone with an EV can participate in
maximizing the usage of the chargers.

The WhatsApp group changed a lot how we use those chargers, since it facilitated the access to them without the need to
repeatitively go downstairs phisically to check if they are free or not.
However, if an EV owner is not in the group, it put them at a significantly unfair disadvantage. As soon as a charger is
freed and annonced on the WhatsApp group, its members will be aware well before an outsider even gets a chance at
snatching it.
Even tho WhatsApp is free and accessible to all major platforms, we understand that some people might not be willing to
use it for whatever their reasons are: privacy concerns with a Meta owned app or phone number accessible to the members
of the group, technology barriere... But are open to suggestions to make sure everyone is included.

## Rules

In order to make sure everyone gets a turn, we have the following rules:

* A charge is limited to 3h usage. At which point the charger should be freed whether the car is charged or not.

These rules are set by the HOA and up for change anytime. But we, the members of the WhatsApp group, would like to
conduct a comprehensive study of the historical usage of the chargers to petition a change of the rules that is helping
its users and based on data rather than being arbitrary.

## Charging History Study

For this study, we will use the charging history CSVs pulled from the Tesla chargers:

* [Left charger](Previous%2012%20months%20charge%20sessions%20left%20charger.csv)
* [Right charger](Previous%2012%20months%20charge%20sessions%20right%20charger.csv)

We will be using only the last 30 days' data.

How many charging sessions happened?

How many charging sessions went over 3h? What percentage of the total sessions?

How many charging sessions went over 4h? What percentage of the total sessions?

How many charging sessions went over 5h? What percentage of the total sessions?

Can you insert an ASCII graph of how busy each hour of the day are over 10 bars?

The electricity rate is 0.14$/kW. What was the cost of the charging sessions?

Can you suggest potential changes to the rules that would make the chargers more available to more people while still
being fair and not too restrictive?
For example, would a 4h limit be better than a 3h limit? Or 2h limit?
Should we have a grace period overnight? Since people are not expected to wake up in the middle of the night.
